PROBLEM 4: Explanation
----------------------

The solution to this problem in O(n) is so simple.

Since we know that only 0s, 1s and 2s are allowed in the list to be sorted,
we can just traverse this list one time and take each element and put it in 
a separate list: so we put all zeros in one list, ones in another and twos
in a third list.

At the end we simple concatenate the three lists:

[0,0,.] concat [1,1,...] concat [2,2,...]
