PROBLEM 6: Explanation
----------------------

It is easy to compute the min and max of an unsorted array in a single traversal O(n)

We intialize two variables that hold the min and max values

then we take each element from the array and we update the 'min' variable by
assigning the list element to it if the latter is lower. 

We do the same for the 'max' variable by checking out if the list element we
took is higher and then assigning it to the 'max' variable if it is the case.
