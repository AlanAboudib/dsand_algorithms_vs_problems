Problem 1: Explanation
----------------------
I solve this problem by a divide and conquer approach.

I start from the observation that the sqrt for a number > 1 can at most be equal
to half of the number (sqrt(4) = 2). 

So, I limit my search to the the integers in the interval [0, number /2]
Within that interval, I apply a binary search with complexity of O(log(n))
to find the solution using the fact that:

if x > y => sqrt(x) > sqrt(y) for x, y in R+
